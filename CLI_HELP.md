## `sshm ls`

List all SSH hosts

Reads ~/.ssh/config. No files are written or modified.

**Usage:** `sshm ls [OPTIONS]`

###### **Options:**

* `-s`, `--show` — Show full hostnames (default: masked)



## `sshm clone`

Clone an existing SSH host

Reads and writes ~/.ssh/config only. No other files are accessed.

**Usage:** `sshm clone <SOURCE> [NAME]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<SOURCE>` — Source host alias to clone from
* `<NAME>` — New host alias name (prompted if omitted)



## `sshm export`

Export SSH config and public keys into a backup archive

Reads ~/.ssh/config and top-level ~/.ssh/*.pub files, then writes a local .zip archive. No private keys are read. No network requests are made.

**Usage:** `sshm export [OUTPUT]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<OUTPUT>` — Output archive path (default: ./sshm-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.zip)



## `sshm import`

Import SSH config and public keys from a backup archive

Reads a local .zip archive, validates it, then restores ~/.ssh/config and matching top-level ~/.ssh/*.pub files. Existing files that will be overwritten are backed up first. No private keys are read. No network requests are made.

**Usage:** `sshm import [OPTIONS] <ARCHIVE>`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<ARCHIVE>` — Backup archive path

###### **Options:**

* `-y`, `--yes` — Skip the confirmation prompt



## `sshm create`

Create a new SSH host

**Usage:** `sshm create [OPTIONS] [NAME]`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NAME>` — Host alias name (prompted if omitted)

###### **Options:**

* `-H`, `--hostname <HOSTNAME>` — HostName or IP address
* `-u`, `--user <USER>` — SSH user
* `-p`, `--port <PORT>` — SSH port
* `-i`, `--identity-file <IDENTITY_FILE>` — Path to identity file
* `-J`, `--proxy-jump <PROXY_JUMP>` — ProxyJump host
* `-d`, `--description <DESCRIPTION>` — Host description (written as a comment in config)



## `sshm edit`

Edit an existing SSH host

Reads and writes ~/.ssh/config. If public key content is pasted as the identity file, it is also written to ~/.ssh/<name>.pub. No network requests are made.

**Usage:** `sshm edit [OPTIONS] <NAME>`

###### **Arguments:**

* `<NAME>` — Host alias name to edit

###### **Options:**

* `-H`, `--hostname <HOSTNAME>` — HostName or IP address
